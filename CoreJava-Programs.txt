Write logic to identify min and max elements from array.

input : 10,5,6,8,2

output : Min=2  Max=10


6)Write a java program to read below array values.

array  = {1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0}

Write logic to re arrange array elements as zeros should come first and 1 should come last

output : {0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1}



7) Write a java program to read two strings from keyboard and check those 2 strings are anagrams or not.

inputs :  keep  peek

input:    Mother in law  Hitler woman

Input :   Debit Card & Bad Credit

Input :   Silent Cat  & Listen Act

Source String : Ashok School
Input String : IT
Position :  6

Output : Ashok IT School


10) Write a java program to move all special characters in string to  end of the string.

Input : abc&$%def&

output: abcdef&$%&


11) Write a java program to read a number from keyboard and generate random alphanumeric String with given number of characters.

Input : 5

Output : jG8b7


12) Write a java program to read a string from keyboard then print occurance of each vowel in given string. If vowels are not there then print 'No vowels found'.

input: java
ouput: a-2

input: language
ouput: 

a-2
u-1
e-1



13) Write a java program to identify common elements in 2 arrays.

input:
{1,4,6,8,9}
{4,7,8,3,7}

ouput: 4,8

14) Write a java program to perform union of 2 arrays.
