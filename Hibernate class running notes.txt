CUSTOM GENERATOES IN HB

for developing custom generators

the configuration syntax in mappinf file like below

<id name="eno" column="eid" >
<generator class="pkg.classname.java" />

</id>

we have develop one java class that implemented from IdentifierGenerator (I)

in that class we have to override generate() that returns Serialzable object.
that value will be stored as a identity value as a pk value in table.

First Level /L1 cache/local cache /session cache

cache holds data for temporary peroid
it is by default available in hb no need to configure/enable
it will reduce n/w roundtrips b/w sever and client for multiple times of same request

==================================================================================================================
Hibernate Tools::
1)Command LIne Tools
a.Schema Export
b.Schema Update
c.Schema validater

2)Progaramatic and Configuration Approch
means using "hbm2ddl.auto" property in configuration file
a.create
b.update
c.validate
d.create-drop

3)GUI tools
means we have to add one plug in to eclipse IDE in new Software instalation option in eclipse

add plugin to eclipse by using below url
https://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/neon/stable/updates

for full tutorial watch naresh  it hibernate video

step1::kept ready project with packages and related dependency jars

step2::create configuration file in hibernate prospective wizard

step3::Generate domain class based on table from db using hibernate reverse engineering.

===========================================================================================
to perform bulk  operations 
1)HQL
2)JPQL
3)Native SQL
4)Hibernate Criteria Api
5)JpA Criteria Api

 Native SQL:: 

it is mainly given for to call PLSQL procedures and functions

steps::
1)prepare procedure in DB
2)prepare SQL 92 based query in application
3)call procedure

Procedure::

create or replace procedure p_GET_EMPLOYEE_BY_ID(details out Sys_refcursor,min in number,max in number)as
begin
open details for
SELECT Eid,ename,desg,salary from employee where eid>=min and eid<=max;
end;

============================================================================================

we can call procedures & functions from  Hibernate in 2 ways

a)Traditional Approch

b)Modern Approch

In Traditional Approch we have to follow some common and data base specific rules to call procedures & functions from HB

common rules
------------
follow SQL 92 Syntax
it not supports for pagenating

specific rules
--------------
for oracle DB
-> for parameter must should be out parameter ,type as a cursor(which holds multiple records)
->for function must take return typa as a cursor


Function::
-------------
create or replace function fx_GET_EMP_DETAILS(startRange in number,endRange in number)return
sys_refcursor as
details sys_refcursor
begin
open detail for
select * from employee where eid>=startRange and eid<=endRange
return details;
end;

Advanced Mappings in Hibernate:
1)Component Mapping
2)Inheritence Mapping
3)Assosiation Mapping


1)Component mapping:: If the domain classes are in composition ,but the tables are don'y have a chance to in composition
      in this requirement component mapping is reqired.


In XML Approch ::<Component > tag is uesd

In Annotation Approch :: @Embedded , @Embeddable Are Required
